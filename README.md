# Working with Linked Data and Ontologies Workshop, IslandoraCon 2017

Welcome to the open repository, documentation and materials for the Working with Linked Data and Ontologies workshop at IslandoraCon 2017.

## About the Workshop

This hands-on workshop aims to introduce the fundamentals of linked data technologies and related data modeling questions by walking through creating & exploring RDF data. It aims for an intermediate level (i.e., some knowledge of Islandora is helpful, but not required).

## Workshop Logistics

* 1:30 PM - 3:00 PM on Thursday, May 18th, 2017
* Held in the [Liuna Station Grand Central Ballroom](https://goo.gl/maps/uAeAHFCL2gA2)
* Led by Nick Ruest (York University) & [Christina Harlow (Stanford University Libraries)](mailto:cmharlow@stanford.edu)

- RDF, RDFs, Ontologies, Vocabularies
